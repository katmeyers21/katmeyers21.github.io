              <p>Protracker is an app designed to connect users with professional athletes, celebrities, and friends through their workouts. The app provides a user-friendly platform with a natural extension to existing wearable devices. I created a prototype of the app using Fluid UI.</p>

            <div id="researchdescription">
              <p>Stories are an innate part of human entertainment and have the ability to influence outlooks, thoughts, and behaviors. People are drawn to movies, plays, and books with the best narrative story. Advertisements, a specific form of storytelling, often have major impacts on businesses’ bottom lines. Companies that successfully implement ads are able to communicate their brand worth, values, and beliefs to consumers and move them to action. The goal of this research is to dissect stories in advertisements to uncover common narrative patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of these structures across different industries.</p>

            <div id="researchdescription2">
              <p>The way news is distributed and consumed is changing rapidly with advancing technology. News organizations are for-profit businesses, but these technological advances have brought increasing difficulties in generating revenue through news distribution. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of current news flow and consumption in order to make a recommendation on where news organizations should direct their placement and marketing spend. I developed a survey that would answer the “What, Where, When, How and Why” of news consumption. I also gathered information through observation, work experience in a news organization, and insights from higher-level management to discover how these businesses are adapting to a changing consumer.</p>

            <div id="researchdescription3">
              <p>This study examines how the origin of a social identity predictably affects identity-relevant consumption behavior. Results from three experiments demonstrate that consumers have fewer negative associations for chosen than endowed social identities, dislike dissociative out-groups more strongly for chosen than endowed identities, and that identity origin affects conformity and divergence decisions.</p>
